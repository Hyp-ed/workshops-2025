# Getting Started with Rust

This workshop will get you started with Rust, a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It is a modern language that is designed to be safe, concurrent, and practical.

## Why are we using Rust, I hear you ask?

Good question

## Background

## Installation

To get started with this workshop and the rest of your time in the Software team, you will need to install Rust. Luckily this is very easy, and completely cross-platform.

Our [Getting Started With Rust Wiki page](https://github.com/Hyp-ed/hyped-2025/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Rust) has a guide on how to install Rust on your machine, you can also find the guide [here](./install_guide.md). If you have any problems, please ask the Head of Software, one of the Project Leads, or any of the other Software team members who have already installed Rust!

## Projects

These projects are all taken from the excellent Rust Book. The book is available online at [https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). It is highly recommended that you read through the book as you work through these projects, as it will give you a much better understanding of the language and its features. The book is very well written and easy to follow, so don't be afraid to dive in!

I'm not expecting you to complete all of these projects, so if you get stuck or don't have time to finish them all, don't worry! Just do as much as you can, and make sure you understand what you've done. _Programming in pairs is a very useful strategy for learning which you could use here_. We will be building on top of the basic concepts you learn in these projects in the coming workshops, particularly the Rust Blinky Lights workshop and the Sensors workshop where you will program an I2C temperature sensor. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me or any of the other Software team members.
